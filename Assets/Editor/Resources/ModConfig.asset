  title: Equations X
  author: eXish
  description: 'At some point in your lives you''ve seen many different kinds of equations.
    These came from probably either a math or science class. Hope you''ve kept that
    knowledge because this module is all about them!


    So this is my first module, and while I made the rookie mistake of not noticing
    that an Equations module had already been made people still liked my idea. So
    I had to officially name it Equations X, mainly because if I named it anything
    other than equations it would just not be right. This is not the official sequel
    to Equations by AAces (the guy with the original Equations module), but instead
    my own module that came completely from my mind, so please don''t think that this
    was inspired by that module.
